# Forex Project

### Overview

The foreign exchange market is where the trading of currency from different countries happens.
The different banks release news about the different currencies.
I want to be able to take and read this news and be able to use it and other variables as indicators on which direction the currency will go (up/down/sideways).
I want to use NLP and other machine learning methods to accomplish this.



## High-level folders

- `results` - contains the deliverables from the project.
- `scripts` - contains the final scripts that built the items in the `results` folder.  Each script should be concise and mapped to the deliverables in the `results` folder.
- `data` has files that are smaller than 100mb provided by the client and built by you.  Note that a `big_data` folder can be created in the repository and that it will be ignored for data larger than 100mb.
- `references` contains a folder for the project proposal and any other `reference_material.`
